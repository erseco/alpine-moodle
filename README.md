Moodle setup for Docker, build on [Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/).
The image is only +/- 70MB large.

Repository: https://github.com/erseco/alpine-moodle


* Built on the lightweight image https://github.com/erseco/alpine-php-webserver
* Very small Docker image size (+/-70MB)
* Uses PHP 8.4 for better performance, lower cpu usage & memory footprint
* Support for HA installations: php-redis, php-ldap (also with self-signed certs)
* Multi-arch support: 386, amd64, arm/v6, arm/v7, arm64, ppc64le, s390x
* Optimized for 100 concurrent users
* Optimized to only use resources when there's traffic (by using PHP-FPM's ondemand PM)
* Use of runit instead of supervisord to reduce memory footprint
* Configured cron to run as non-privileged user https://github.com/gliderlabs/docker-alpine/issues/381#issuecomment-621946699
* docker-compose sample with PostgreSQL and Redis
* Configuration via ENV variables
* Easily upgradable to new moodle versions
* The servers Nginx, PHP-FPM run under a non-privileged user (nobody) to make it more secure
* The logs of all the services are redirected to the output of the Docker container (visible with `docker logs -f <container name>`)
* Follows the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) to make it easy to understand and adjust the image to your needs

## Usage

Start the Docker containers:

    docker-compose up

Login on the system using the provided credentials (ENV vars)

## Running Commands as Root

In certain situations, you might need to run commands as `root` within your Moodle container, for example, to install additional packages. You can do this using the `docker-compose exec` command with the `--user root` option. Here's how:

```bash
docker-compose exec --user root moodle sh
```

## Configuration
Define the ENV variables in docker-compose.yml file

## Pre and Post Configuration Commands

You can define commands to be executed before and after the configuration of Moodle using the `PRE_CONFIGURE_COMMANDS` and `POST_CONFIGURE_COMMANDS` environment variables. These can be useful for tasks such as installing additional packages or running scripts.

Example `docker-compose.yml` configuration:

```yaml
services:
  moodle:
    image: erseco/alpine-moodle
    environment:
      SITE_URL: "http://localhost"
      DB_TYPE: "pgsql"
      DB_HOST: "postgres"
      DB_PORT: 5432
      DB_NAME: "moodle"
      DB_USER: "moodle"
      MOODLE_USERNAME: "admin"
      MOODLE_PASSWORD: "admin"
      PRE_CONFIGURE_COMMANDS: "echo 'Running pre-configure commands'"
      POST_CONFIGURE_COMMANDS: "echo 'Running post-configure commands'"
```

### Installing Plugins from URL

You can also install Moodle plugins directly from a URL using the `install_plugin.php` script. This can be useful for automating plugin installations during container setup.

Example command:

```sh
php admin/cli/install_plugin.php --url=https://github.com/mohessaid/moodle_local_plugin/archive/refs/heads/master.zip --run
```

This command will download and install the specified plugin into your Moodle instance.
